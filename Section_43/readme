Section 43
Basic NN Example Exercises
Using the same code as before, please solve the following exercises:

    1. Change the number of observations to 100,000 and see what happens.

    2. Change the number of observations to 1,000,000 and see what happens.

    3. Play around with the learning rate. Values like:

    a) 0.0001 

    b) 0.001

    c) 0.1

    d) 1 

are all interesting to observe.

    4. Change the loss function. L2-norm loss (without dividing by 2) is a good way to start.

    5. Тry with the L1-norm loss, given by the sum of the ABSOLUTE value of yj - tj. You can check the exact formula in the respective notebook.

    6. Create a function f(x,z) = 13*xs + 7*zs - 12. Does the algorithm work in the same way?

   

Useful tip: When you change something, don't forget to RERUN all cells. This can be done easily by clicking:

Kernel -> Restart & Run All

If you don't do that, your algorithm will keep the OLD values of all parameters.

You can either use the file “Minimal_Example_All_Exercises” for all the exercises, without solutions, or check the solutions of each one separately in the files we have provided. We suggest that you start with the “Minimal_Example_All_Exercises” file.
